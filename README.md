# Dreamward

**AI-powered accounting automation for small businesses.**

Dreamward ingests invoices and receipts from Gmail or CSV uploads, uses Claude to extract structured data + categorize transactions, tracks revenue + expenses + mileage across events, manages wholesale/consignment invoices with one-tap follow-up reminders, and generates annual tax summaries you can hand to your CPA — all in one place.

## Who it's for

Small-business operators who outgrew spreadsheets but don't want QuickBooks's complexity:

- Market vendors & craft sellers
- Freelancers & consultants
- Food trucks & mobile businesses
- Etsy / Amazon FBA sellers
- Small landscaping & service companies
- Photographers & creatives
- Bookkeepers & small CPA firms (often used on behalf of their own clients)

## What it does

**Smart intake.** Connect Gmail → Dreamward auto-fetches invoices and receipts by label. Or upload a CSV from Square, Stripe, QuickBooks, Xero, or Wave — Claude figures out the column mapping automatically. Duplicate detection prevents double-processing.

**AI extraction + classification.** Claude reads each document and extracts vendor, amount, due date, invoice number, plus a categorization tied to your industry's taxonomy (~87 categories across 11 industries).

**Events + mileage.** Track revenue per market day. Per-event P&L (revenue − booth fees − expenses − mileage). Google Maps Distance Matrix computes mileage automatically from your home address.

**AR aging.** Track wholesale/consignment invoices. Aging buckets (Current / 1–30 / 31–60 / 61–90 / 91+ days). Record payments (audit trail). Send polite follow-up reminders to overdue customers — one tap, Reply-To routes back to you.

**Annual tax reports.** Generate cash-basis annual summaries (Pro plan). Export as CSV (full ledger) or PDF (printable cover sheet). Email straight to your CPA with one click — both attachments, Reply-To set so their reply goes back to you.

## Local development

### Prerequisites
- Node 20.6+ (uses `--env-file` flag for the migration runner)
- A PostgreSQL connection (the same Railway prod DB works for dev, or a local Postgres)

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone + install
git clone <this-repo>
cd dreamward
npm install

# 2. Copy the env template and fill in real values
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local — see comments in the file for where to grab each value

# 3. Start the dev server
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### Common commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Next.js dev server on :3000
npm run build        # Production build
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit; CI-equivalent type check
npm run lint         # ESLint
```

### Database migrations

Migrations live in `db/migrations/` numbered sequentially (`0001_*.sql`, `0002_*.sql`, etc.). Apply them via the env-file-based runner — **not** Railway's web query console, which silently fails on multi-statement DDL:

```bash
node --env-file=.env.local scripts/run-migration.mjs db/migrations/0008_add_invoices_tables.sql
```

Each migration is idempotent (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`). Safe to re-run.

### Deploys

- `master` branch → tracks `origin/main` → Vercel deploys on push.
- Push via `git push origin master:main` (deploy branch is `main`, not `master`).
- Vercel rebuilds + deploys in ~60–90 seconds after the push lands.

## Architecture notes

- **Tenant scoping.** Every DB query that touches client data carries `WHERE client_id = $1`. Tenant safety enforced at the query layer, not at a middleware boundary.
- **Plan gating.** Routes hard-code `isPlanAllowed(plan)` checks at the top of each handler. The canonical plan-feature mapping lives in `lib/plans.ts`.
- **Cash basis.** Tax reports use cash-basis accounting (income on receipt, expense on payment). Accrual is deferred.
- **Honesty flags.** Computed numbers carry source attribution (`rateSource: "config" | "fallback" | "current-year-only"`). UI surfaces a visible notice when a fabricated/fallback value is in play. Never let a fabricated number pass as a real configured one.
- **Atomic commits.** Multi-step features ship as atomic commits in sequence. Each commit typechecks clean before the next starts. See `session-notes/` for per-phase build cadence.

---

## Status

See [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) for the full phase breakdown and current state. Phases 0 through 7b shipped as of May 2026; Phase 7c (Schedule C line mapping + quarterly estimates) is the next greenfield arc.

## UTM convention (marketing links)

Every Dreamward link used OFF-site (Reddit, Instagram, Etsy listings,
market-organizer emails, printed QR codes) carries UTM params so channel
attribution works from day one:

```
?utm_source={reddit|instagram|etsy|organizer|flyer}&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=<specific>
```

- `utm_source` — the platform, from the fixed list above (extend the list
  here first so spellings never drift).
- `utm_medium` — `organic` for unpaid placements; `paid` if ads ever run.
- `utm_campaign` — the specific push, kebab-case (e.g. `market-day-calculator-launch`,
  `ig-bio`, `nwi-organizer-outreach`).

Example: `https://godreamward.com/tools/market-day-calculator?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=market-day-calculator-launch`
