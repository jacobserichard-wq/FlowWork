// Pricing model — "Built for people. Priced for people." Every paying
// customer gets every product feature; price is set purely by business
// size (trailing-12-month revenue tracked through the app) and the only
// other differentiator is service level (support response time).
//
// 7-band revenue ladder (sub-session 33 → smoother-ladder revision):
// the old 4 tiers (Dream/Maker/Growth/Pro) jumped too coarsely — a
// $5.5k seller paid the same as a $45k one. The ladder below has
// narrower bands so price tracks size fairly. The customer never picks
// a band: they sign up onto the trial, check out onto the band their
// revenue maps to, and a monthly cron (lib/revenueTier.ts) nudges the
// band up or down one step at a time as revenue moves.
//
// EVERYTHING derives from the BANDS array — thresholds, the revenue→
// band lookup, the Stripe price map (lib/stripe.ts), the billing
// display tiles, and the marketing "find your price" slider — so the
// ladder can never drift between surfaces. Trial keeps 14-day full
// access; Canceled retains a read-only dashboard.
//
// Legacy 4-tier plan values (dream/maker/growth/pro) are still treated
// as paying for back-compat until existing rows are migrated to bands
// (db/migrations/0027_*). They are NOT valid PaidPlanName values.
