// app/sitemap.ts
//
// Sitemap for the public marketing surface. Next serves this at
// /sitemap.xml (special metadata route — previously a 404, which left
// Google to stumble onto the SEO pages on its own).
//
// Keep this list in sync when adding /for/* industry pages or
// /compare/* competitor pages — those exist to rank, and an entry here
// is how crawlers find them. Authenticated app routes stay out (they're
// behind sign-in and disallowed in robots.ts anyway).
